# solana-twitter-enhanced

This project allows users to send tweets.
The main difference is the dynamic sizing of tweets is allowed, which takes away the main problem of static rigid cost of tweet no matter what is user is willing to send, sometimes it's just emoji or sometimes long para.

Note: The app folder contains obsolete vuejs code

Target blockchain: SOLANA (Anchor framework)

Stack: Rust, Typescript, Svelte(coming soon)
